To create a link in a GitHub README that opens your Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) directly in Google Colab when clicked, you can use a URL format specific to Colab. Here's how to do it:

Get the Colab Link:

Open your Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab.
Click on "File" in the top-left corner of the Colab interface.
Select "Save a copy in GitHub..." from the dropdown menu.
Choose the repository where you want to save the notebook and select the desired branch.
Click the "OK" button.
Copy the Colab Link:

After saving the notebook to GitHub, Colab will generate a link. Copy this link, which will look something like:
''' https://github.com/ethopic/hhd-ethiopic-I/blob/main/Test__demo_HPopt_Attn_CTC.ipynb

Create a Markdown Link:

In your GitHub README or Markdown document, create a clickable link using the Colab link you copied:
[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://github.com/ethopic/hhd-ethiopic-I/blob/main/Test__demo_HPopt_Attn_CTC.ipynb)

in case of image, just drage the image from the directory in your local computer and release it on the editor space
